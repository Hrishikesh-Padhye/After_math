# After_math
This tool is for maintaining important logs of a system such as login, processes, privilege escalation, etc.<br/>
Initially, the focus of development will be on to making a script that will store all the ssh remote login logs and send it to a remote system in the network or to a cloud. Also it will notify the user of all the successful and unsuccessful logins.<br/>
<br>
## How to run the code
```
python3 After_math.py
```
